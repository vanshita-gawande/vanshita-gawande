## Hi there 👋
## I’m Vanshita 

I’m a Software Developer (MERN) exploring how to use AI like LangChain, vector databases and RAG to solve real problems.
I like building projects end-to-end - from clean UIs to working APIs and databases - and improving a little every day.

## What I’ve worked on
- A sports slot-booking platform with dashboards, authentication and booking flow.
- A blockchain-based supply chain prototype where users can scan a QR to verify product details.
- Internships where I worked on frontend–backend integration, REST APIs and responsive UI development.

## Skills I’m growing with
React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, JavaScript, Python, Java, LangChain, RAG systems, Git, Postman

## What you’ll find in my repos
- Small experiments where I try out new backend or AI concepts
- Web apps built as practice projects
- Clean, beginner-friendly code with comments
- Projects I’m still improving as I learn new things

## If you're checking my profile
I’m still early in my journey, but I enjoy learning and building.
If you have suggestions or want to collaborate on something simple but meaningful - I’m always open to it!
